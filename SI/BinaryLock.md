# Binary Lock 

A binary lock is a type of lock that is not typically used in database management systems because it is too restrictive.

This lock can only have two states:
    - **Locked**: The resource is locked. Can only be accessed by the process that acquired the lock.
    - **Unlocked**: The resource is unlocked. Requesting processes can acquire the lock.
