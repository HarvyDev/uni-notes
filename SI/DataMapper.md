**The data mapper is a layer of software that separates the in-memory objects from the database.** Its responsibility is to **transfer data between the two and also to isolate them from each other.** With Data Mapper, the in-memory objects do not need to know that there is a database present. They need no SQL interface code, and certainly no knowledge of the database schema.
