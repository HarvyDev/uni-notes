# Persistent Stored Modules

Persistent Stored Modules (PSM) are a way to store and reuse code in the database. This strategy makes it possible to have code that is executed on the server side, which can be reused. This is a powerful feature that can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.

Some of the modules that are available in the database are:
    - [[Procedures]]
    - [[Functions]] 
    - [[Triggers]]
